* [Technologies Used](#technologies-used) : Jypiter notebook, python, pandas, dataframes libraries.
* [Conclusions](#conclusions):  Performed data analysis through EDA and identified defaulters.
* [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) performed EDA on the Loan Data Set

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here:
It is the consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

- What is the background of your project?
The provided Loan data set is analysed using EDA Analysis which includes Univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis and through different graph plots.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
In this project through data analysis, we are trying to identify loan defaulters and also trying to give inputs on decession to provide loan to proper persons.
